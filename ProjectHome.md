If you want to experiment with all the yubikey libraries and you don't own a real hardware yubikey or if you don't want to reprogram your yubikey you can use this simulator. For more information about the yubikey please have a look at http://www.yubico.com

In the links sections you can try the online generator.

You will need the AES128 PHP-class by Jose Manuel Busto to use this generator. You can find it in the links-section.

I hope you enjoy the simulator - Please feel free to comment on it..
